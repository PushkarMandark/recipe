    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite
      Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the
      chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the
      cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.

      a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly
      browned, about 10 minutes.Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1
      teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and
