    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I am always looking for ways to jazz up the boring burger and came up with
      this after having a delicious caprese salad. Be sure to use fresh basil
      and the marinated tomatoes are a must!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 thick slices tomato</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ordered list</h2>
    <p>
      <strong> Step 1</strong> Whisk the balsamic vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper
      in a small bowl. Pour over tomato slices to marinate. <br /><strong>
        Step 2</strong
      >
      Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
      <br /><strong> Step 3</strong> Mix ground beef, tomato paste, basil,
      Parmesan cheese, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Form
      beef mixture into 4 equal patties. <br /><strong> Step 4</strong>Cook on
      the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of
      doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read
      thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees
      C). Top each burger with mozzarella cheese; allow to melt. Serve on
      hamburger buns with marinated tomato slices.
